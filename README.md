## studentSpringBootDemo

The project is a Spring Boot application for managing student information. Here is a brief explanation of the key components:

1. **`StudentService` Interface**:
    - Defines the contract for student-related operations such as getting a student, getting all students, adding a new student, deleting a student, and updating a student.

2. **`StudentServiceImpl` Class**:
    - Implements the `StudentService` interface.
    - Contains methods to handle CRUD operations for students.
    - Uses `StudentRepository` to interact with the database.
    - Methods include:
        - `getStudent(Long studentId)`: Retrieves a student by ID.
        - `getStudents()`: Retrieves all students.
        - `addNewStudent(StudentDto studentDto)`: Adds a new student.
        - `deleteStudent(Long studentId)`: Deletes a student by ID.
        - `updateStudent(StudentDto studentDto)`: Updates a student's information.

3. **`StudentRepository` Interface**:
    - Extends `JpaRepository` to provide CRUD operations for `Student` entities.

4. **`Student` Class**:
    - Represents the student entity with fields such as ID, name, email, and date of birth.

5. **`StudentDto` Class**:
    - Data Transfer Object for transferring student data between layers.

6. **`StudentConfig` Class**:
    - Configuration class that initializes some student data using `CommandLineRunner`.

7. **Unit Tests**:
    - `StudentServiceImplTest` class contains unit tests for the `StudentServiceImpl` class using Mockito for mocking dependencies.

The project uses Java, Spring Boot, and Maven for dependency management.
